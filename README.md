Screensaver of the vintage Apple logo made purely with `NSBezierPath` and masks in Swift. Now with support to EDR!

Compatible with macOS 11.5 and later.

### Install

1. [Click here to Download](https://github.com/Corkscrews/fruit/releases/download/1.3/FruitScreensaver.saver.zip)
2. Open **Fruit.saver** (double click).
3. `"Fruit.saver" can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer` will appear, press `OK`.
4. Open `Preferences`.
5. Select `Security & Privacy`.
6. Select `General`.
7. On the bottom side, select `Open Anyway`.

If this doesn't work, please do the manual described below.

### Install from the source code

1. Clone the project.
2. Open the `Fruit.xcodeproj`, select `FruitScreensaver` target  and `Archive` it.
3. Open the `.xcarchive` generated by right-click and select `Show Package Contents`, go to `Products` folder till you find the `.saver` file, double click on it.
4. You should have installed it by now, go to your screensaver settings and confirm if the screensaver is selected.

If the screenshot displays a black screen, you need to do some actions to get it back:

1. Delete your old output files before running a new build.
2. Build your project.
3. Go to **Activity Monitor** and force quit any `legacyScreenSaver` processes (especially on Sonoma – we’ll discuss this more [later](https://zsmb.co/building-a-macos-screen-saver-in-kotlin/#macos-sonoma)).
4. Go to **System Settings**, choose any screen saver other than your custom one.
5. Delete your custom screen saver from **System Settings**.
6. Quit **System Settings**.
7. Install your new screen saver and perform the dialog dance.


### Why it's not available in `brew cask`?

Since `brew cask` limits your projects that have at least 50 stars, I am unable to make it available in their repository until I get this minimum number of stars. Please help me and give a star in the project. :)

### Special thanks

I would like to thank Mátrton Braun for helping me to fix the issues related to macOS Sonoma in his article: https://zsmb.co/building-a-macos-screen-saver-in-kotlin Also thank you
